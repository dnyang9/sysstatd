CS3214 Project 5 - System Status Web Service

An implementation of basic HTTP web service that publishes a Linux system's status as reported by the kernel via the
/proc file system.

The server supports HTTP 1.0/1.1 protocols.

The server services two pieces of information about the system:

/loadavg - load average of the system based on /proc/loadavg
/meminfo - memory information of the system based on /proc/meminfo

It also supports 3 additional functionalities:

/runloop - starts a loop in parallel that spins for 15 seconds. Provided to observe change in load average.
/allocanon - allocate a block of anonymous memory. Provided to observe change in available memory.
/freeanon - frees a block of most reccently allocated anonymous memory.


File Descriptions:

server.c - Main code for the actual server. handles all necessary functions
           regarding server operation specified by the assignment handout.

json.c - Parses /proc/meminfo and /proc/loadavg as well as commands issued to 
         the server.

rio.c - Wrapper functions for RIO package provided by csapp.

When the server starts, the command line flags determine its behavior.
It creates socket and listens for connections. When a connection is made, a new thread is spawned to process requests.
Each functions are called based on the request made.
